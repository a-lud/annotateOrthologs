# Parse Funannotate 'annotations.txt' files

The program `Funannotate` is a great gene-prediction tool that integrates a range of 'best-practices'
gene annotation methods into a single pipeline. One of the final outputs generated by the tool is an
'annotations.txt' file that contains all the functional information associated with each gene model.
This file is tab-separated and can be quite large if numerous annotation sources were provided during
the running of the `Funannotate` pipeline. As such, I wrote the tool `parseFunannotate.go` to handle
extracting some key fields from each file.

NOTE: This tool was more of a fun project to use `GO`. This could easily have been done in `R`, just
not as quickly.

## Usage

The progam can be run using the following command.

```bash
$ go run parseFunannotate.go
```

The tool can also be compiled using

```bash
$ go build parseFunannotate.go
```

The help page for the tool is shown below.

```
usage: msaSummary [-h|--help] -i|--in "<value>" -o|--out "<value>"

                  A simple tool to parse the annotation output from Funannotate
                  and generate a topGO compatible TSV for GO enrichment.

Arguments:

  -h  --help  Print help information
  -i  --in    Filepath to Funannotate '<species>.annotations.txt' file.
  -o  --out   Output filepath for tab separated GO Term file.
```

Given a single `Funannotate` annotations file, this program will quickly parse the gene-symbol and GO
Term information. 

## Output

The output from this tool is a *TSV* file with the following columns: gene-identifier, transcript-identifier,
gene-symbol and GO Terms. An example of the output for a single file is shown below.
